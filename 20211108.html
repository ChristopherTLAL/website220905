	                      </ol>
   		                  <p>This essay will discuss whether &ldquo;a true critical period, that is, a declining learning capacity within a specific age range and a biological reason for the decline, are absent in second language acquisition&rdquo;. Age of onset (AO) represents learners&rsquo; first exposure to a second language (L2), identified to be an essential predictor of L2 achievement (Birdsong, 2006). Although a general negative correlation between AO and ultimate attainment (UA) was recognised, its pattern is somewhat inconsistent among previous studies in which some argued for a continuous deterioration of learning capacity whereas some identified a &lsquo;critical period&rsquo; after which the L2 learners would experience a slump in learning ability (Birdsong, 2005). For the latter theory (Critical Period Hypothesis, CPH), nativism proposed a biology-based or neurology-based account, arguing that the sudden regression is bound to the decay or inactivation of the innate language learning faculty (cf. Jackendoff &amp; Pinker, 2005; Johnson &amp; Newport, 1989; Pinker, 2003).<br>
   		                    Although these discussions in CPH lasted for decades with more than 100 studies reporting the AO-UA link (M. Long, 2013), little quantitative research synthesis was done to attest to the validity of these theories partly due to the methodological issues such as sampling, instrumentation, statistical procedure, and confirmation bias (DeKeyser, 2013; Vanhove, 2013). The very first meta-analysis for the link between AO and L2 morphosyntactic acquisition confirms medium to large effects (<em>Zr</em> = -.40), which called for further corroboration (Qureshi, 2016). However, that study only reported an omnibus finding but not analysed the focal relationship in different AO groups, which failed to confirm whether a &lsquo;critical point&rsquo; exists in this link. Therefore, the present meta-analysis attempts to answer whether a critical period exists for L2 morphosyntactic acquisition, before discussing whether this critical period (if it exists) is the result of certain biological alterations.</p>

                          <p>Limited by time, the scope of inclusion was <a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK3">specified </a>to be the most reputable journals in the field of SLA. Using Web of Science Core Collection (SSCI-indexed for the Category of Linguistics), a total of 154 research articles were retrieved based on the topic of &lsquo;age of onset&rsquo; or &lsquo;critical period&rsquo; with the filter of &lsquo;Morpho* OR Gram* OR Synta*&rsquo;. Afterwards, to ensure the validity of the present meta-analysis, I set four criteria including that the paper should (1) use quantitative method(s), (2) measure the morphosyntactic L2 achievement of the participants, (3) be based on correlational <a name="_Hlk86836934"></a><a name="OLE_LINK4">design</a>, (4) report the r-based effect sizes (ES) of AO-UA relationship of L2 users. In the end, only 13 out of 154 papers fulfilled all the inclusion criteria with 25 correlational ESs reported in a wide range of AO from 1 to 71. </p>

                          <p>Most ESs show a negative correlation between AO and L2 morphosyntactic learning, ranging from -.73 to -.05. There is only one study reporting two positive ESs (.016 and .151) for the effects focusing on participants&rsquo; <em>accuracy on case</em> and <em>syntactic correspondences</em> (see Hopp, 2011 for more).</p>

                          <p>Table 1 shows the results of Bayesian meta-analysis (for prior and posterior analysis, see Appendix 1). The averaged effect size <em>μ</em> (<em>r</em>-based) was estimated to be -.352 (SD = .056, 95% CI = -.468 to -.242) which exceeded the &lsquo;medium&rsquo; benchmark proposed by Cohen (1988). This level of effect echoes Qureshi's (2016) results on the same relationship (<em>Zr</em>&nbsp;=&nbsp;−0.40), leading to the conclusion of that L2 learners experience a medium-level decline of morphosyntactic learning capacity over age. However, one limitation of Qureshi (2016) is that it &ldquo;did not attempt to find out whether a sudden decline exists in learners&rsquo; proficiency at a specific age&rdquo; (p. 158). If this decline follows an unvarying pattern, it still negates the existence of a &lsquo;critical period&rsquo; which features a sudden drop of learning capacity.</p>

                          <p>The present study synthesised the weighted ESs at each AO, via running Bayesian meta-analysis in 71 points of AO. As the same result prevails the AO from 43 to 71 due to the insufficient number of studies, the analysis will be mostly about the AO from 1 to 42.<br>

                            Figure 1 presents how the effect size changes over AO with 4 <a name="OLE_LINK1">polynomial orders identified </a>(accounting for 86.9% variances compared with 3 orders accounting for 25.2% variances and 5 orders accounting for 87.1% variances). Since ESs represent the slope of correlation, the trendline here indicates how the speed of decline changes at different points of AO. If the ESs remain constant for certain span (e.g., from 6 to 15), it illustrated a steady and continuous decline in learning capacity. To compare, if the ESs notably change, the learning capacity undergoes a discontinuity for its declining pattern (e.g., around 16). In Figure 2, the change of ES was illustrated as the change in the declining speed of learning capacity.<br>

                            Figure 2: An Approximate AO-UA Link based on Figure 1<br>
                            Interestingly, between an AO of 1 to 42, the data displays four critical points in the L2 morphosyntactic learning process at approximately 5, 16, 30, and 40. The first discontinuity point (5) indicates a sudden drop in the declining speed of learning capacity which moderates slightly at around 16. The age of 30 represents another slump in learning capacity which ends at 40. This finding expands our understanding of CPH by distinguishing two periods (i.e., 5-16 and 30-40), during which the learning capacity of L2 morphosyntax deteriorates significantly. The 5-16 period confirmed the studies which detected a significant difference between those learning L2 before and after approximately 16 (e.g., 15 in Abrahamsson, 2012; 17.4 in Hartshorne et al., 2018). The lower bound of 5 also verified that individuals started to lose their learning capacity very early rather than at the beginning of puberty (see M. H. Long, 1990, for a similar argument). Nevertheless, as far as the author knows, the 30-40 period was not investigated by previous studies. The next subsection will try to examine the underlying mechanism behind these patterns, with a focus on whether it resonates with the biological development of human beings.<br>

                          <p>If variables other than chronological age contribute to the decline, there might exist confounding effects which means an ES overestimate the extent of AO predicting UA by involving the effects exerted by other predictors (MacKinnon et al., 2000). In this regard, a general conclusion of SLA is that L2 learning can be predicted by a wide range of factors, both external (e.g., medium of instruction, Agirdag &amp; Vanlaar, 2018; input quality, De Wilde et al., 2020; and corrective feedbacks, Majlesi, 2018) and internal (e.g., motivation, Dörnyei, 1994; attitudes, Masgoret &amp; Gardner, 2003; and emotions, MacIntyre &amp; Vincze, 2017). For instance, in an EFL context where formal prescriptive instruction predominates L2 learning, students&rsquo; AO would mark their starting age of school education which also negatively correlates with the L2 achievement (for some other examples, see Stevens, 2006). In these scenarios, the AO-UA link appears partly because of the education-UA tie in contrast to only biological reasons.<br>
                                        This was also verified by that, of the articles covered by the present meta-analysis, many reported either a partial correlation after controlling certain variables or how other variables interact with AO. For instance, Larson-Hall (2008) demonstrated a weakening of ES (<em>r</em>) from -.42 to -.38 when adding Amount of Input as the control variable. Similarly, in Bosch et al. (2019), AO exerted a very strong effect on Length of Exposure (<em>r</em> = -.74) which possibly mediates the AO-UA relationship. Additionally, in some studies with more than one AO group, the demographic features of different groups are usually not homogeneous (e.g., the late L2 group might harbour a relatively long span of residence, Abrahamsson, 2012). Therefore, the emergence of the declining curve (e.g., Figure 2) discovered by the present study is not only attributed to chronological age.<br>
                                        However, biological reasons should also be embraced because the pattern with two fast-declining periods is largely age-specific. Typically, rare is a cross-culturally valid age-specific pattern of non-biological variables (e.g., L2 motivation might not suddenly yield larger effects on UA after a specific age in all different research settings). This essay, as a result, will highlight some possible biological bases for the pattern illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The 5-16 period coincides with the biological maturation process starting from <a name="_Hlk86911353">Adrenarche at around 5 </a>(Becker, 2001, p. 711) to the end of Puberty at around 16 (Phillips, 2014, p. 18). This echoes Lenneberg's (1967) justification of that <a name="_Hlk86911327">cerebral plasticity </a>(i.e., the ability to reorganise neural networks in growth, Fuchs &amp; Flügge, 2014) was lost after reaching adulthood. In the field of L2 acquisition, this loss entails an insensitivity to language input possibly because <a name="_Hlk86903346"></a><a name="OLE_LINK8">the mature learners fail </a>to activate the visual cortex (Hensch, 2005) and the neurotransmission does not prioritise information-receiving any more (Hensch &amp; Bilimoria, 2012).<br>
                                        One possible biological reason behind the 30-40 period, which has not been examined in CPH, might be <a name="_Hlk86911497">the deceleration of metabolism </a>that usually happens between the early 30s to mid-50s (Aldwin et al., 2017). The cerebral energy metabolism, as tested in behavioural neuroscience, correlates with general learning and memory capability (Lannert &amp; Hoyer, 1998), which might contribute to L2 learning capacity. However, it cannot account for the post-40 slowing down of the learning capacity as shown in Figure 2. I hypothesised that practical intelligence peaked in the 40s moderates the AO-UA relationship (Wagner, 2000) because it notably relates to L2 acquisition compared with academic intelligence. Following the difference between L2 learning (explicit) and L2 acquisition (implicit, Krashen, 1982), practical intelligence is a particularly pertinent concept as it emphasises the cognitive responses to informal tasks which are ill-defined, problem-oriented, with multiple solutions, and related to daily experience (Wagner, 2000). </p>

                          </ol>
                          <p>The present study suffers from four primary limitations. The first is the non-inclusive data collection method focusing on the articles published in linguistics. However, CPH was examined in diverse disciplines beyond linguistics (e.g., psychology, neurology, cognitive sciences, and education). Also, the focus of morphosyntactic acquisition is still broad because the acquisition of morphemes and syntactic rules may not share the same process (cf. Blom, 2008; Schwartz, 2009). Third, due to the restriction of data, the present study cannot provide reliable results after the AO 42. With more studies done among <a name="_Hlk86900503"></a><a name="OLE_LINK6">elder </a>L2 learners, the existence of and reasons for a critical period can be further attested (e.g., to observe whether another critical point emerges according to the reduced expression of genes affecting synaptic plasticity after age 40, Lu et al., 2004). Furthermore, the discussion on the underlying biological reasons follows a domain-general paradigm, which attempts to explain the declining pattern based on general cognitive and neurological changes. An alternative approach might conclude that the declining curve help verify how the language-specific faculty degenerated.</p>

                          </ol>
                          <p>The present meta-analysis confirmed the negative correlation between AO and L2 morphosyntactic acquisition, identified a development curve of learning capacity with two fast-declining periods, and discussed whether this curve resulted from biological reasons. Previous findings on a similar relationship were replicated with a medium-level negative correlation of the AO-UA link. A new declining pattern with four critical points (i.e., two fast-declining periods) was developed, the reasons for which were argued to be dynamic with both non-biological and biological ones. Concerning biological reasons, the maturation process with the gradual loss of cerebral plasticity (from adrenarche to puberty) represents the 5-16 fast-declining period; the deceleration of metabolism was believed to trigger the 30-40 fast-declining period; and the development of practical intelligence matches the deceleration after 40. </p>

                  <P>I conduct interdisciplinary research and undertake practical projects in linguistics, psychology, multilingualism, and education. My academic publications are primarily about how linguistic experiences influence the development of human beings, with a focus on behavioural inclinations, emotions, diversity (critical literacy), memory, and meta-linguistic awareness. I am also concerned about how universities and other institutes can raise education equity through sustainable projects.</P>
