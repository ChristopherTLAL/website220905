					<strong>1.Introduction<br></strong><br>Individual Differences (IDs) variables have been confirmed as significant factors influencing second/foreign language acquisition in the past decades (e.g. Baker, 1996; Dewaele et al., 2017; Krashen, 1982). One enduring question received the attention from the field of applied linguistics for decades, that is, what is ‘a good language learner&rsquo;. Considerable research projects have uncovered a series of variables, including cognitive factors (Doughty, 2019), motivation (Lake, 2013), personality (Dewaele, 2012), and emotion (MacIntyre &amp; Vincze, 2017). With those findings, some scholars call language learners ‘birds of different feathers&rsquo; (Korzilius et al., 2011).<br><br>Within this line of studies, three important trends could be recognised: (1) compared with cognition-based factors (e.g. aptitude), more malleable IDs variables such as personality attract scholarly attention (Wang, 2020); (2) researchers have been reorienting themselves to examine lower-order personality traits which exerted ‘a large proportion of the meaningful findings&rsquo; in addition to their higher-order counterparts (Dörnyei &amp; Ryan, 2015, p. 34) ; (3) scholars have gradually pay their attention to the ‘relatively unexamined&rsquo; positive constructs such as enjoyment rather than their negative counterparts (Macintyre et al., 2019, p. 262).<br><br>Following these trends, many studies have identified a general positive correlation between so-called positive personalities and language achievement. The author has also conducted some relevant research on non-cognitive, lower-order, and positive psychological constructs such as grit (Wei et al., 2020), tolerance of ambiguity (Wei et al., under review), and enjoyment (Wang, 2020). However, within the previous studies, it is assumed that positive personality can also exert negative affections, which may destructively influence language learning (see Theoretical Framework for more). Therefore, this project will explore the dynamic nature of so-called positive personality, which may simultaneously arise positive and negative emotions.<br><br>The essay will then elaborate on theoretical framework, methodology, findings, and discussions.<br><br><strong>2.Theoretical Framework<br></strong><br>The Mediating Model developed and confirmed by previous empirical study will be followed (Wang, 2020). In this model, the positive personality (independent variable) affects the appraisal-based positive emotion (mediator), which will then influence language achievement (dependent variable). The strength of effects being mediated by positive emotion is named mediating effects or indirect effects. Apart from the mediators, the effects left are direct effects. The total correlation between two sides, which is also the sum of indirect and direct effects, was called total effects.<br><br>Although the mediating role of emotion was confirmed, the present project will add negative emotion into the model for exploration. That is because the previous findings showed that the positive personality tolerance of unfamiliarity cannot exhibit any bivariate correlation with foreign language proficiency but can still be mediated by positive emotion enjoyment. Based on statistical analysis (Hayes, 2009), it is hypothesised that this positive personality also brings about negative emotion(s), which may cancel out the effect of enjoyment.<br><br>In the new model presented in Figure 1, positive personality will concurrently generate positive and negative emotions which may push and pull. The exploration of this phenomenon will lead to our reconsideration of the binary definition of positive and negative personality (see Discussion for more).<br><br>

					Figure 1: Hypothetical Interaction between Positive Personality and L2 Proficiency<br><br>To confirm this framework, the four concepts were operationalised as four constructs, including risk-taking (positive personality), exhaustion (negative emotion), enjoyment (positive emotion), and self-rated English proficiency (language achievement). The reason to choose risk-taking but not tolerance of ambiguity is that the former is a lower-order personality trait without enough discussion (Dörnyei &amp; Ryan, 2015) whereas the latter has been investigated in many recent studies (Dewaele &amp; Li, 2013; Wei et al., under review; Wei &amp; Hu, 2019). The inclusion of exhaustion is from the hypothesis that the risk-takers may experience more energy-consuming activities compared to their counterparts. In addition, the choice of enjoyment is because a risk-taker may perceive the ‘uncertain&rsquo; (Herman et al., 2010) language learning process to be comparative easier to control which will trigger positive emotions such as enjoyment.<br><br>Based on this framework, three research questions will be addressed in the present paper.<br><br>RQ1: Are there total effects between risk-taking and L2 proficiency?<br><br>RQ2: Can both positive emotion enjoyment and negative emotion exhaustion act as mediators?<br><br>RQ3: What is the difference of mediating effects between two selected emotions?<br><br><strong>3.Methodology<br></strong><br><strong>3.1.Instruments<br></strong><br>In addition to the basic demographic questions, four subscales were utilised including the 11-item English Enjoyment Scale of Achievement Emotion (Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha = .91), 5-item Exhaustion Scale (Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha = .77), 2-item Self-reported English Proficiency Scale (Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha = .93), and 4-item Risk-taking Scale (Cronbach&rsquo;s alpha = .71, after deleting one item). When selecting the instruments, the author consulted the Chinese general social survey (Bian &amp; Li, 2012) and the original Achievement Emotion Questionnaire (Pekrun, 2006). Using the default Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), it seems that all the four constructs fail to have high-level goodness of fit. However, following the suggestion of performing Bollen-Stine Bootstrap (Enders, 2002), the boosted Chi-Square in our sample was adjusted, leading to the acceptable model fit indexes (see Table 1 for more).<br>

					<strong>3.2.Data Collection<br></strong><br>The questionnaire was distributed via an online survey website Wenjuan Xing. The participants were ensured the rights to withdraw from the anonymous project whenever they want to. Based on convenience sampling method, between 28th May and 2nd June 2020, a total of 239 English language learners were surveyed. After deleting the speeders whose answering time is below 90 seconds which is the theoretically minimum time to finish the questionnaire, 202 out of 239 cases were identified to be valid. Employing R Programme to conduct Power Analysis (MacCallum &amp; Hong, 1997) based on RMSEA, it is ensured that sample size is enough for the later analysis.<br><br>There are 131 (64.8%) females and 71 males, with an average age of 21.13 (SD = 3.79). Also, based on convenience sampling (restricting most of the respondents to be XJTLU students), over 90% of the participants (N = 186) reported that they received EMI (English as the medium instruction) education. Considering the nature of the sample, in the following analysis, the scope of generalisation will be restricted to the undergraduates receiving EMI education.<br><br><strong>3.3.Data Analysis<br></strong><br>The software IBM Amos will be used to develop a Structural Equation Model (SEM) to analyse the data. The reason for using SEM is twofold: (1) in the field of applied linguistics, variables are often ‘multivariate in nature&rsquo; (Plonsky, 2018) which rejects the traditional bivariate approach; and (2) conducting mediating analysis via SEM bootstrap function of IBM Amos is better than the previous approach based on simple linear regression which necessitates the normality of the indirect effect (Bollen &amp; Stine, 1990).<br><br>As some respondents left some items blank, data imputation was used concerning the requirement of SEM (Carter, 2006). Following the trend of using Bayesian approach (Fairfield &amp; Charman, 2019) which will ‘lead to more appropriate decisions&rsquo; (Burton et al., 1998, p. 320), Bayesian imputation was employed to handle the missing values.<br><br>Limited by the skewed distribution, the affective constructs including enjoyment (11 items) and exhaustion (5 items) are summed as an item parcel approach to adjust the asymmetrical distribution (Kline, 2015). If item parcelling methods were used, the factor loading and error were set according to the suggestions (see Marsh et al., 1998 for more).<br><br><strong>4.Findings<br></strong><br>Before the mediating analysis, bivariate linear regression was performed to examine the coefficient between risk-taking and English proficiency. The statistically significant finding (adjusted R2 = .036, p &lt; .0005) confirmed the positive association between the two variables. The effect sizes index R2 demonstrated a ‘small&rsquo; variance-accounted-for strength (Cohen, 1988). This is consistent with previous research on lower-order personality traits arguing that an R2 of .02 can be recognised as ‘large&rsquo; in this line of research (Wei &amp; Hu, 2019). This can be an indicator for the total effects in our model, but more studies in the future should be conducted to confirm this result.<br>

				<p>
					Figure 2: Structural Equation Model<br><br>As presented in Figure 2, a mediating model was developed to assess the interaction of selected variables. Despite the factor loading (item reliability) of one indicator in risk-taking is slightly below .6 (.55), all the other ones are quite high. All regression coefficients of the indirect effects and direct effects are almost statistically significant in the model, except the path Exhaustion→English Proficiency (p = .089). However, as discussed by previous researchers (Hayes, 2009), bootstrap should be employed in SEM to further explore the mediating effects in the model.<br><br>Therefore, as presented in Table 2, the three effects were generated by this more refined method. If the lower and upper bound of confidence interval does not cross zero, it could be identified that the effects are statistically significant. From both the percentile (default) and bias-corrected methods, the three effects of mediating analysis are confirmed to be existent. Nevertheless, it should be noticed that the indirect effect in Table 2 is the overall influences of two mediators, which will be compared in the next section.<br>

					From Table 3 which presented the comparison of indirect effects, the unique variances of exhaustion and enjoyment were analysed. In terms of exhaustion, it should be noticed that the percentile bootstrapping method failed to yield a statistically significant result (Estimate = .013upper = .034 lower = -.003, p = .105). After bias-correction, however, the result can narrowly pass the significance test (Estimate = .013upper = .039 lower = .000, p = .044). It confirmed our hypothesis that positive personality can arouse negative emotions. As this result is close to non-significance, future replications are required with conservative paradigms. Differently, the mediating role of enjoyment, which has been explored by several previous studies, was verified with strong evidence (p &lt; .0005 in both methods).<br>

				<p>
					<br>The indirect effects difference also indicates that the mediating role of enjoyment is statistically significantly stronger than that of exhaustion (p = .002 and .003. respectively). This result is expected because the positive influence of positive emotions is verified by considerable articles, but that of negative emotions is not. Also, from previous theories, one widely-accepted presupposition is that positive personality help evoke positive emotions and fight against negative emotions such as foreign language classroom anxiety (Dewaele &amp; Ip, 2013). Nevertheless, although the stronger predictability of positive emotion enjoyment was substantiated, the existence of the mediating effect of negative emotion still rejects the previous theoretical framework.<br><br><strong>5.Discussion<br></strong><br>If the findings of the present essay are valid, a new dynamic model on personality in the field of second language acquisition should be developed. As shown in Figure 3, after deconstructing the binary definition of positive and negative personality, this self-developed model serves personality as ‘lens&rsquo; to ‘refract&rsquo; students&rsquo; evaluation of the situation, and therefore develop different emotions to the individuals. For example, an introvert student may have different evaluation from those extrovert students, but whether this introversion will lead to positive evaluations or negative ones is also largely based on the negotiation between personality and situations such as class design, learning strategies, teaching methods and so on.<br>

					Figure 3: A dynamic model for personality and emotion<br><br>Among the previous findings, the general positive correlation was detected between positive personalities (e.g. tolerance of ambiguity, L2 grit, and openness to experience) and language achievement. This leads the practitioners in this field to identify the students with so-called positive personalities as ‘good language learners&rsquo;. However, as discussed, if students with every kind of personality may exert both two sides of emotions, this classification of good or bad students shows our implicit discrimination on one group of learners. It is suggested that we should not simply label those students with so-called negative personality as bad language learners, and vice versa.<br><br>In the new model, three teaching implications can be provided. Firstly, practitioners should concentrate on the teaching methods or learning materials which can help develop students&rsquo; positive emotions. Secondly, these situational class design should also adjust based on learners&rsquo; personalities, which will ‘refract&rsquo; or influence the emotions arose. Thirdly, different students should enjoy dissimilar or tailored materials which could enhance the learning efficiency of all but not only the ‘good&rsquo; ones.<br><br><strong>6.Conclusion<br></strong><br>In conclusion, this study has confirmed that positive personality may lead to both positive emotions and negative emotions. The author would like to call for a more dynamic view on personality, but not simple bivariate philosophy. As practitioners, if we use personality to judge whether a student is a good or bad language learner, we are implicitly discriminate a group of students. Although individual differences exist, and indeed influence language learning, we are not supposed to label different students. So-called good language learners will have negative evaluations, and vice versa. If language learners are birds of different features, every bird has the right to fly.<br><br>There are also limitations to the present study, which could be addressed by future research. For example, this study is to struggle against the binary thinking in personality as it is relatively stable, and the stable traits are likely to be the label on language learners. Comparatively, the evaluation-based emotions are more temporary which may not become a stereotype. However, in the future research, we also have to reflect our structuralism paradigm on emotions. Will positive emotion bring about negative effects, and vice versa?<br><br><br><strong>7.Bibliography<br></strong><br>Baker, C. (1996). Foundations of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism.

					Shijie [ʂʅ51 tɕjɛ35] is an MPhil student at the University of Cambridge. I am interested in psycholinguistics, multilingualism, language acquisition, and quantitative research methods. I conduct research about how previous language experiences will influence the later development of foreign languages, with a focus on meta-linguistic awareness, parameter setting, and language-specific individual differences variables. I am also concerned about the empowerment of special language learners and users.
